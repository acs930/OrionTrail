Physics Project part 1

For the code, download the .cpp file, for the "game"  download physics.  Then run it.
This is phase 1 of my physics project, phase 2 is bringing it into a 2d game that has an interface and gameplay and more physics in it.  Phase 3 is incorporating the MIT unity engine that can depict time dilated objects in 3d and making the game 3D.

Phase 2 will be complete by Aug 2015
Phase 3 may be complete by Aug 2015 depending on how ambitious I am.
